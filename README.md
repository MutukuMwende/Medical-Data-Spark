# Heart-failure-project
A data-driven project that uses machine learning to predict heart failure based on clinical patient data, aiming to support early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

# ðŸ§  Medical Imaging Data Handling (BraTS 2021)
ðŸ“„ Overview
This project focuses on loading, exploring, and manipulating 3D medical imaging data (in NIfTI format .nii.gz), commonly used in brain tumor segmentation tasks such as BraTS 2021 Task 1.

# Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to classify brain MRI images into categories such as tumor or no tumor. The model automatically extracts features from input images through convolutional layers, captures spatial hierarchies via pooling layers, and uses fully connected layers for final classification. CNNs are highly effective for this task because they learn complex patterns (like tumor shapes and textures) directly from raw image data without manual feature engineering.
